The datasets used in this study are eight publicly available datasets that we downloaded from Kaggle and TCGA platforms. These datasets include both the raw and preprocessed data. Since the raw datasets IM101, IM102, and IM105 are too large to upload to the platform, we provide the following URLs for access:
